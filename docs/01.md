
## Emmet

`Emmet` serves as an essential toolkit for web developers, enabling the use of shortcuts that expand into complete code snippets for crafting HTML and CSS. This system is based on a familiar abbreviation structure widely adopted by developers, transforming into fully-fledged HTML markup and CSS rules.

## CDN

A content delivery network (CDN) denotes a distributed network of servers strategically working together to deliver Internet content swiftly. The objective is to ensure high availability and optimal performance by distributing the service geographically in relation to end users.

## React's Name

React earns its name from its responsive nature. Developed by a prominent organization, React enhances user interface development by swiftly adapting or "reacting" to user interactions such as mouse clicks, submissions, and typing.

## crossorigin Attribute

The crossorigin attribute configures the request mode to an HTTP CORS Request. This attribute is employed to facilitate resource sharing between different domains, particularly handling CORS requests and determining whether it's secure to share resources across domains.

### Syntax

`<script crossorigin="anonymous|use-credentials">`

## React and ReactDOM

React is a JavaScript library for constructing User Interfaces, while ReactDOM is also a JavaScript library that facilitates the interaction of React with the DOM.

The react package encompasses React.createElement(), React.Component, React.Children, and other helpers for elements and component classes. In contrast, the react-dom package provides ReactDOM.render(). Additionally, react-dom/server supports server-side rendering with ReactDOMServer.renderToString() and ReactDOMServer.renderToStaticMarkup().

## React Build Versions via CDN

The development build refers to the application stage before it's made public, while the production build represents the publicly available application. The development build is notably slower (approximately 3-5x) compared to the optimized production build.

## async and defer Attributes in the script Tag

- Async - The async attribute, a boolean attribute, downloads the script in parallel to page parsing, executing it as soon as it's available without blocking HTML DOM construction.

- Defer - The defer attribute, also a boolean attribute, downloads the script in parallel to page parsing but executes it after the page has finished parsing, allowing the browser to continue processing HTML without waiting for the script.

## Library and Framework

A framework comprises pre-written code that establishes a structure for software development, dictating the flow and architecture of an application. On the other hand, a library is a collection of pre-written code offering specific functionalities.

In essence, a library provides a set of methods for developers to call as needed, while a framework dictates the overall flow of an application and directs the developer on what to provide. One well-known JavaScript library is widely used for building User Interfaces, whereas a prominent JavaScript framework facilitates the complete development process.
